# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Dataset : [`House Sales in King County, USA`](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DA0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera/data/kc_house_data_NaN.csv)


## About the Dataset
This dataset contains various features of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living space, waterfront views, and other attributes. The goal is to analyze and model the data to predict house prices effectively.

## Project Overview
This project follows a structured approach to **house price prediction** using machine learning, covering multiple stages of data handling and modeling:

### Modules Covered
1. **Importing Data**  
   - Loaded the dataset into Pandas DataFrame for processing.  
   - Examined basic statistics and structure.  

2. **Data Wrangling**  
   - Handled missing values and cleaned the dataset.  
   - Performed necessary transformations for model input.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Conducted descriptive statistics and visualizations.  
   - Used correlation matrices, scatter plots, and boxplots to understand feature relationships.  

4. **Model Development**  
   - Applied regression models, including **Linear Regression** and **Ridge Regression**.  
   - Used **Polynomial Transformations** for improved predictions.  
   - Split data into training and test sets for validation.  

5. **Model Evaluation and Refinement**  
   - Calculated **RÂ² Score** to measure model performance.  
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters to enhance accuracy.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Scikit-Learn**
